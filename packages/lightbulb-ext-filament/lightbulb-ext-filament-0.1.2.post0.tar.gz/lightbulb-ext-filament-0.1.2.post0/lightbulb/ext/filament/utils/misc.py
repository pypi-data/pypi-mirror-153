def pass_options(func):
    """
    First order decorator that causes the decorated command callback function
    to have all options provided by the context passed as **keyword** arguments
    on invocation. This allows you to access the options directly instead of through the
    context object.

    This decorator **must** be below all other command decorators.

    Example:

        .. code-block:: python

            @lightbulb.option("text", "Text to repeat")
            @filament.utils.prefix_command("echo", "Repeats the given text")
            @filament.utils.pass_options
            async def echo(ctx, text):
                await ctx.respond(text)
    """

    async def decorated(ctx: context.Context) -> None:
        await func(ctx, **ctx.raw_options)

    return decorated
