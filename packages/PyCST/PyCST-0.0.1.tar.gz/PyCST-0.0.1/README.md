# CST-Python-API/Wrapper

Some features of CST can be controlled via COM objects, this in combination with a feature rich IDE (such as Spyder or PyCharm) allows for more sophisticated levels of optimisation/automation than what is available through the standard package.

Integration with the Python environment will allow for an immersive post-processing experience that combines powerful scientific packages with a sophisticated 3D EM solver.

Note, this is inspired by the unofficial MATLAB API. Much work and restructuring is needed, this is more of a proof of concept really.
