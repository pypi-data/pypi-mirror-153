# Monkeytale v0.2.1

> "The book is a program." - [Matthew Butterick](https://docs.racket-lang.org/pollen/big-picture.html)

Monkeytale is a markup language for documenting and composing a story world and its novels within flat files. I am building this language to meet my opinionated needs for improving insights into my own writing.

## Design Principles
- Don't opine. Mirror what is, but is not seen.
- Story structure lives within the writing and not file and folder structure
- Only flat files with version control and durability of access
- Simple syntax
- No configuration

## Planned Functionality
- Compose one or multiple narratives from story components
- Navigate to any named story component
- Execute from continuous integration server
- Derive story structure knowledge from story components and their content
- Provide plugin mount point for generation of documents from story structure extracted by Monkeytale

## Dismissed Functionality
- Advice on how to improve or correct the writing
- Typography and formatting, other than emphasis (italics)
- Tables of content and indexing
- Project management and goal tracking (unless hard deadlines ever become a reality for me)
- Stuff other folks have done better

## Development Progress
Monkeytale is developed in spare time and uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) and [Semantic Release](https://pypi.org/project/python-semantic-release/) to track its, equally spare, progress.

As per Semantic Versioning: "Major version zero (0.y.z) is for initial development. Anything MAY change at any time. The public API SHOULD NOT be considered stable."

Check the [change log](https://github.com/MLAOPDX/monkeytale/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for the latest updates.

## Decisions
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) will be the programming language for Monkeytale and any plugins that folks might want to build
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VSCode) will be the text editor of choice
- [GruntFuggly's ToDoTree](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Gruntfuggly.todo-tree) extension for VS Code will be used to support navigation
- [Markdown Preview Enhanced](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced) extension for Markdown and Mermaid diagram display and conversion to docx using [PanDoc](https://pandoc.org/) and PDF using Safari.
- [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) as execution platform
- Use .@ as the file extension to indicate Monkeytale files
