    Runs a full diffusion analysis on a single migration hop using NEB.
    
    Typically, this workflow is not ran directly -- but instead, you would
    use diffusion/all-paths which submits a series of this workflow for you.
    
    For a given migration path, supercell structures are generated for
    the start and end points of the migration, where vacancy-based diffsion
    is used. These supercells are relaxed using the relaxation/neb-endpoint 
    workflow and then interpolated to generate 7 images. These 7 images are
    then relaxed using NEB within the diffusion/from-images workflow.

    This is therefore a "Nested Workflow" made of the following smaller workflows:

        - relaxation/neb-endpoint (for both start and end supercells)
        - a mini task that interpolated relaxed endpoints and makes images
        - diffusion/from-images
    
    Currently, this workflow will not run through the command-line, as we
    have not implemented a file format for MigrationHop's yet.
