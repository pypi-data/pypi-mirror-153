    Given a compositon, this class can be used to create all structures from
    the prototypes in the AFLOW library.

    At the moment, this does not allow for disordered versions of prototypes.
    This would be like using a supercell of a 1-site prototype for a 2-site target
    composition. A concrete example of this is using the NaCl rocksalt prototype
    for a NaClBr or NaKClBr compositions -- each of these compositions would
    require a supercell of the NaCl prototype structure becuase they need more
    than 2 sites.

        # Ca2N, Ca8N4, and so forth.

        # number of sites in the structure.

        #   (1) the number of wyckoff sites is compatible with nelements OR nsites
        #   (2) the number of individual sites is compatible with nsites
        # This is because we can only insert at symmetrically unique sites (bc
        # we ignore disoreder superlattices here) and the total number of sites
        # after symmetry operations needs to match our target composition.

        # example the Spinel prototype has nsites=14 and nsites_wyckoff=3.
