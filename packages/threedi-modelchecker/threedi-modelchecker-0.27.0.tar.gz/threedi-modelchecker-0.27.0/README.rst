Threedi-modelchecker is a tool to verify the correctness of a 3Di model.
The goal is to provide a tool for model builders to quickly check if his/her 
model is correct and can run a 3Di simulation. It provides detailed 
information about any potential errors in the model.

Threedi-modelchecks works with both spatialite and postgis databases. However, 
the database should always have the latest 3Di migration: https://docs.3di.lizard.net/en/stable/d_before_you_begin.html#database-overview 

Installation:

    pip install threedi-modelchecker


Threedi-modelchecker is also integrated into the ThreediToolbox Qgis plugin: https://github.com/nens/ThreeDiToolbox


Example
-------

The following code sample shows how you can use the modelchecker to run all configured
checks and print an overview of all discovered errors::

    from threedi_modelchecker.exporters import format_check_results
    from threedi_modelchecker import ThreediModelChecker
    from threedi_modelchecker import ThreediDatabase

    sqlite_file = "<Path to your sqlite file>"
    database = ThreediDatabase(
        connection_settings={"db_path": sqlite_file}, db_type="spatialite"
    )

    model_checker = ThreediModelChecker(database)
    for check, error in model_checker.errors(level="WARNING"):
        print(format_check_results(check, error))


Command-line interface
----------------------

Use the modelchecker from the command line as follows::

    threedi_modelchecker -s path/to/model.sqlite check -l warning 

By default, WARNING and INFO checks are ignored.


Migrations
----------

Migrate the schematisation file to the latest version as follows::

    threedi_modelchecker -s path/to/model.sqlite migrate

The file will be change in-place.


Development
-----------

A docker image has been created for easy development. It contains an postgis 
server with an empty 3Di database to allow for easy testing.

Build the image:

    docker-compose build

Run the tests:

    docker-compose run modelchecker pytest

See `Creating revisions <threedi_modelchecker/migrations/README.rst>`_ for 
instructions on how to change the 3Di model schematisation.

Release
-------

Make sure you have zestreleaser_ installed.
