    The function will export data based on SQL query into csv file.
    For data loading, create a file named: "credentials.env" which has database credential details in following format:

        credential_file_path (string): File Path for Credential File (as it is set to credentials.env). Please enter file path with double backslash "\\\\"
        export_file_path (string): File Path to export the data (as it is set to occasion.csv). Please enter file path with double backslash "\\\\" 
    Example:
        export_data_to_csv("D:\\\\Analysis\\\\Occassion Analysis","C:\\\\Analysis\\\\Occassion Analysis\\\\test")
