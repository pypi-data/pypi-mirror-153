    The function will export data based on SQL query into csv file.
    For data loading, create a file named: "credentials.env" which has database credential details in following format:
        DATABASE = 'database_name'
        USER = 'user_name'
        PASSWORD = 'password'

    Parameters:
        credential_file_path (string): File Path for Credential File with file name.
        export_file_path (string): File Path to export the data with file name.
    Example:
        export_data_to_csv("D:\\\\Analysis\\\\Occassion Analysis\\\\credentials.env","C:\\\\Analysis\\\\Occassion Analysis\\\\test\\\\occasion.csv")
