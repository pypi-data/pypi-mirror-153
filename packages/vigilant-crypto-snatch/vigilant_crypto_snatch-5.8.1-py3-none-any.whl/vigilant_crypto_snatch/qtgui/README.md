# Qt GUI

The Qt GUI is contained in this sub-package. The remainder of the library doesn't depend on this sub-package, but this depends on the library. The used [PyQt library](https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro) is licensed under the GPLv3. This part of the code therefore is also GPLv3 licensed.
