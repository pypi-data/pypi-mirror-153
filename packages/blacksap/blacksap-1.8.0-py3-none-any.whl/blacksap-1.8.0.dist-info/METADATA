[blacksap] is a Python based RSS tracker that is designed to watch multiple RSS feeds from torrent sites and download 
any new torrent files to a specified location.  If you have your torrent client configured to watch the same directory 
the files will be automatically picked up!

### License

[blacksap] is released under the [GNU General Public License v3.0], see the file LICENSE for the license text.

## Installation

As of version 1.8, blacksap is supported the latest versions of Python3 and PyPy3!

The most straightforward way to get blacksap working for you is:

```
pip install blacksap
```

__NOTE:__

By default, the [blacksap] executable gets put in __/usr/local/bin/__

## Getting Started
You can get help from [blacksap] by running:
```
blacksap --help
```

### Tracking a new feed
To track a new RSS feed run:
```
blacksap track "https://example.com/search?q=latest_torrents&fmt=rss"
```

### Viewing tracked feeds
To view all the feeds being tracked, run:
```
blacksap tracking
```

### Untracking a feed
To untrack a feed type:
```
blacksap untrack "https://example.com/search?q=latest_torrents&fmt=rss"
```

### Run blacksap
To get [blacksap] to check all RSS fees and download any new torrent files, simply run:
```
blacksap run --output ~/Downloads/
```

__NOTE:__

On its first check of a new feed, [blacksap] will only download the most recent torrent file.  If you would like to 
download more files (or none at all), override the number of files to download with the `--count` flag!  Don't 
forget to specify the URL of the new RSS feed or you will force that number of files to download from every 
tracked feed!

## Extras

### Preferences

The feeds that blacksap tracks are stored in `~/.blacksap.cfg`.  If you want to reset blacksap you can simply delete
this file.  It is also stored in JSON format, so feel free to edit the file in place if needed.

### App Settings

App specific settings are also stored in this file in an "app" hash.  The following settings are currently available
for configuration

* threads - Integer for number of threads to use (Default is None)
* proxies - Hash of proxies to use for 'http' and 'https' (Default is None)
* ipv6 - Boolean (Default is True)

### Feed Settings

In version 1.5 and later of blacksap you can add a special "rules" key to each feed that contains a list of regular 
expressions that torrent files in the feed must match in order to be downloaded by blacksap.  The regular expressions
are processed in order and when the first match is found no other rules are applied.  If no "rules" key exists then 
any new files will be downloaded.


#### Example Settings

Below is an example blacksap configuration file:
```json
{
	"app": {
		"threads": 4,
		"ipv6": false,
		"proxies": {
			"http": "socks5://user:pass@fqdn:port",
			"https": "socks5://user:pass@fqdn:port"
		}
	},
	"feeds": [{
		"url": "https://example.com/search?q=latest_torrents&fmt=rss",
		"name": "Example Torrents",
		"hash": "51930c6ea13972d61d7783da0910aa89",
		"enabled": true,
		"new": false,
		"last": "My_Awesome_File.torrent",
		"rules": [
			"Awesome_File"
		]
	}]
}
```

### Mac OSX LaunchAgent
If you are running OSX please check out the LaunchAgent in the git repo extras folder.  You can add it to your
`~/Library/LaunchAgents/` directory and that way blacksap will run every hour and download new torrents 
automatically!

### UNIX/Linux Cronjob!

Add the following to your user's crontab (using `crontab -e` command as your user) to schedule blacksap to run every
hour (downloading to a `~/torrents/` directory):
```
# Blacksap cronjob
0 * * * * /usr/local/bin/blacksap run -o ~/torrents/
```
