# Readme

`gcgen`, or general code generator, is a tool which enables straight-forward
code generation in between hand-written code in your source files.

To do this, gcgen introduces the concepts of snippets. Snippets are
regions within your source file, marked by a start- and an end-line, whose
contents are automatically replaced by the output generated by the
corresponding snippet function.
