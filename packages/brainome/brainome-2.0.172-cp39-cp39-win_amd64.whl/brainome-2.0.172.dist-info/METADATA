# Brainome(tm) 

## Project description

Brainome is a **data compiler** that automatically solves supervised machine learning problems with repeatable and reproducible results and creates **standalone python predictors**. 

Brainome’s philosophy is that data science should be accessible to all:

* Run on your machine or in your cloud.
* Keep your data local.
* Own your model python code - run it anywhere.
* Single “compiler like” command to convert you data in a model in a single step. 
* Automatic data format conversion (text, numbers, etc..).
* No hyper-parameter tuning through measurements.
* Unlimited dimensionality (premium).

Brainome offer unique data insight and helps answer:

* Do I have enough data and the right feature? 
* What features are important (attribute ranking)?
* What model type will work best?
* Is my model overfitting?

Brainome’s predictors: 

* Run as executable or import as library.
* Are hardware independent.
* Are self contained in a single python file and integrate easily in standard CI/CD flow, Github, etc…

Brainome is free for personal use or evaluation.
