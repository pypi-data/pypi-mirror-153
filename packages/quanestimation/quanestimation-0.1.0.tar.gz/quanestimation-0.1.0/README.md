QuanEstimation is a Python-Julia based open-source toolkit for quantum parameter estimation, which consist in the calculation of the quantum metrological tools and quantum resources, the optimization of the probe state, control and measurement in quantum metrology. Futhermore, QuanEstimation can also perform comprehensive optimization with respect to the probe state, control and measurement to generate not only optimal quantum parameter estimation schemes, but also adaptive measurement schemes. 

## Documentation
The documentation of QuanEstimation can be found [here](https://quanestimation.github.io/QuanEstimation/).

## Notes
Welcome to the QuanEstimation community! Feel free to submit issues and pull requests.

We are still working hard uploading our package to the PyPI and making our docs online. And we are also waiting for our [QuanEstimation.jl registration](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/pull/61399#issuecomment-1142241816) to be auto-merged, which will be much more convenient for our users to setup their julia environment.  
So, it's highly recommended to wait until all these works are finished, and follow our documentations to have a better using experience.

Nevertheless, if you still want to manually install the toolkit, you can
1. `git clone` this repo to local and `cd QuanEstimaiton`,
2. `pip install .` or `python setup.py install` to install the python package,
3. [download julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/) and install. Or simply via `pip install jill` and `jill install`,
4. set up  julia environment by adding the dependences. Currently this step is somewhat cumbersome,
    1. check [Julia's docs](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Pkg/) if you  are not familiar with julia's package management,
    2. add the deps [here](https://github.com/QuanEstimation/QuanEstimation.jl/blob/e1b3b5ab5ac23c01eacd56de5440fcdcf36358d4/Project.toml#L6) to your julia environment **via julia's REPL** manually
    3. and then run python from command line to set up pyjulia, see [pyJulia’s documentation](https://pyjulia.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
    ```python
        import julia
        julia.install()
    ```
5. `import QuanEstimation` to load the package. 
6. then run the examples in `quanestimation/examples/` folder and have fun.

## Installation
Run the command in the terminal to install QuanEstimation:
