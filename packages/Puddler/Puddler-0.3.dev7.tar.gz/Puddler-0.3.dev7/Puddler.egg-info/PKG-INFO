### Currently, in buggy alpha state?
___

### Installation:
```
$ python -m pip install Puddler --upgrade
$ python -m puddler
```

**Latest update:**
+ fixed a few things from yesterday's auth update
+ clarified output in series mode (do you want to play this next? {series-name} {season-name} {ep-name})

#### I also decided to abandon the puddler to path thing, since that can't be configured in setup.py (as far as I know).

___

### Information:

Currently, only the most basic features (+discord presence).

But at least both emby and jellyfin are supported.

Playback using search-term and some weird playlist mode.

___

To-Do list:

+ think of other *useful* features that require **0** effort to implement
