### Currently, in buggy alpha state?
___

### Installation:
```
$ python -m pip install Puddler --upgrade
$ python -m puddler
```

**Latest update:**
+ rewrote auth
  + script isn't going to authenticate each time, only when you've been logged out
  + device id has been set to "Puddler" (here come the duplicate device entries)
+ remove debug parameter lol

##### The auth thingy has been *written* in like 1 hour, don't expect it to run perfectly.

Also:

I will add the `setup.py` later on and figure out how to put puddler in path, so please stand by and install via pip.

___

### Information:

Currently, only the most basic features (+discord presence).

But at least both emby and jellyfin are supported.

Playback using search-term and some weird playlist mode.

___

To-Do list:

+ think of other useful features that require **0** effort to implement
