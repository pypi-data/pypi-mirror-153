Features
--------

* This is used to scan code that has been copied from a third party and you can't guarantee
  that there haven't been any changes.  Run this scanner and point it to both the directory
  you are scanning and a copy of the original verified source.  This will generate a
  report that can be imported directly into SonarQube.

In order to use, run a command like the following before running the sonar scanner::

$ sonar-code-diff diff --report_file=./.sonar-code-diff-reports/code.report ./components/Package/src /opt/verified_source/Package/src
$ sonar-scanner  -Dsonar.externalIssuesReportPaths=.sonar-code-diff-reports/code.report
