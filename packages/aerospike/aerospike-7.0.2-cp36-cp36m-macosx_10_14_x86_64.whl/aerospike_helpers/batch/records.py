records.py defines objects for use with aerospike client batch APIs. Currently batch_write, batch_operate,
batch_remove, and batch_apply make use of objects in this file. Typically BatchReacords and underlying
BatchRecord objects are used as input and output for the aformentioned client methods.

    .. note:: APIs that utitlize these objects require server >= 6.0.0.

Example::

    import aerospike
    from aerospike import exception as ex
    from aerospike_helpers.batch import records as br
    import aerospike_helpers.expressions as exp
    from aerospike_helpers.operations import operations as op

    except ex.ClientError as e:

    # or the only failures are FILTERED_OUT or RECORD_NOT_FOUND.
    # Otherwise its value corresponds to an as_status and signifies that
