    """This message creator creates messages with the `LogRecord`'s data nicely formatted in an embed.

    To customise the way the embed looks, you should subclass this class and override any or all of the methods starting with `get_`. All of these (except two) take a `LogRecord`, and most of them simply return the string to put in one of the embed's fields.

    The first exceptions is `get_field_definitions`, which returns a list of tuples of two functions, these are used to get the name or value of the field, respectively. They both take a `LogRecord` and return a string.

    The second exception is `get_new_embed`, which returns an embed prefilled with the fields that should be set on every embed that a `LogRecord` is split into.

    Args:
            colours (Mapping[int, int]): A mapping of log levels to colours. If a log level doesn't have an index in this mapping, the colour of the closest level lower than it will be used. If not provided, sensible selection of colours will be used.
