Description: This class defines two functions: 1 - Given a points shapefile of reference points, a lists of polygon shapefile that subdived the study area, a radius r of interest, the desired coordinate reference system (crs), and a series of points shapefile containing the point of interests (POIs), counts the numbers of POIs inside the defined radius r from the reference points. This number is added to a new database column 2 - Given a points shapefile of reference points, a lists of polygon shapefile that subdived the study area, the desired coordinate reference system (crs), and a series of points shapefile containing the point of interests (POIs), returns the distance between the reference point and the closest POI. The result is added to a new database column
