PasteBinPy
==========
PasteBinPy
---------------
    An easy to learn, use, and contribute to api for python.

--------------

Getting Started
---------------

    To get your pastebin api key, create or login to your pastebin account `here <https://pastebin.com/signup>`__ > after creating your account, `head over to the api documentation <https://pastebin.com/doc_api>`__ and grab your api key under ``Your Unique Developer API Key`` ---

Example
-------

.. code:: py

    import pastebinpy as pbp

    # All thats needed for a successfull response
    pbp.paste("api_key", "title", "body")

    pbp.paste("api_key", "title", "body", raw=1, expiry="10M", privacy="1", format="python")

``pastebinpy.paste()``
----------------------

**API\_KEY** can be retrieved by making a pastebin account and getting your api key from `this link <https://pastebin.com/doc_api>`__

**CONTENT** is the *body* of the paste, the inside that your user will be looking at.

**TITLE** is at the top of the paste, users will probably not notice this, but its a good attribute to still use.

**PRIVACY** has two values, ``0`` being public, and ``1`` being unlisted, meaning only people with the pastebin link can view it.

**EXPIRY** is defining the expiration time and/or time limit that you give your paste. Allowed variables are below.

::

    N = Never
    10M = 10 Minutes
    1H = 1 Hour
    1D = 1 Day
    1W = 1 Week
    2W = 2 Weeks
    1M = 1 Month
    6M = 6 Months
    1Y = 1 Year

**RAW** is the toggle attribute for obtaining a raw pastebin link, with ``1`` equaling the raw pastebin link, and ``0`` being the default, returning the normal pastebin link.

**FORMAT** is the selected language attribute to format and color the content given. ``(e.g HTML, PHP, LUA, PYTHON, BF, CSS, CPP, CSHARP, RUBY, RAILS, etc)``
