Description: daisybell
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        A scanner that will scan your AI models for problems. Currently it focuses on bias testing. It is currently alpha.
        
        
        How to Use
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        First install it:
        
        ::
        
            pip install daisybell
        
        
        Run it in this manner (currently supports models from HuggingFace's repository):
        
        ::
        
            daisybell --huggingface roberta-base --task fill-mask
        
        
        The scan can output files for further analysis:
        
        ::
        
            daisybell --huggingface roberta-base --task fill-mask --output results/roberta-base
        
        Here is another example with a different bias task.
        
        ::
        
            daisybell --huggingface cross-encoder/nli-distilroberta-base --task zero-shot-classification
        
        That's it for now. More will come.
        
        
        Future Work
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * More bias tests. More metrics for bias testing based on the research in the field.
        * Integration with other types of testing (eg. adversarial robustness)
        * More kinds of models besides HuggingFace models. We are especially interested in MLFlow integration.
        * Documentation.
        
        Please contribute if you can. Help is always helpful.
