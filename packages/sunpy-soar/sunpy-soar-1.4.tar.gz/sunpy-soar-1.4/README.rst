When interacting with the sunpy-soar project you are asked to follow the `SunPy Code of Conduct <https://sunpy.org/coc>`_ .

Installation
------------

sunpy-soar requires `python >= 3.7` and `sunpy >= 2.1`. Currently it can only be installed from
PyPI using:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install sunpy-soar

or conda using

.. code-block:: bash

   conda install -c conda-forge sunpy-soar

Example usage
-------------

The code below gives an example of how to search and download Solar Orbiter
data using ``sunpy.net.Fido``:

.. code-block:: python

   # Importing sunpy_soar registers the client with sunpy
   import sunpy_soar
   from sunpy.net import Fido
   import sunpy.net.attrs as a

   # Create search attributes
   instrument = a.Instrument('EUI')
   time = a.Time('2021-02-01', '2021-02-02')
   level = a.Level(1)
   product = a.soar.Product('EUI-FSI174-IMAGE')

   # Do search
   result = Fido.search(instrument & time & level & product)
   print(result)

   # Download files
   files = Fido.fetch(result)
   print(files)

Available search attributes
---------------------------
The easiest way to access search attributes is using
``import sunpy.net.attrs as a``. When constructing a search, ``a.Time`` must be
provided. Other search attributes can be used too - sunpy-soar recognises the
following:

- ``a.Instrument``
- ``a.Level`` - one of ``L0, L1, L2, L3, LL01, LL02, LL03``
- ``a.soar.Product``

The third ``near`` argument to ``a.Time`` is not supported - you will have to
manually filter the results if you want to find the one closest to a given
time.

Maintainence Notes
==================

This package is maintained separately from sunpy core as we expect that the Virtual Solar Observatory will, in time, index all the solar orbiter data products, meaning that the data accessible through this package will already be accessible with sunpy.
The SunPy developers will be maintaining this package on a best-effort basis until that point.
Contributions for new features and bug fixes are welcome.

Changelog
=========

1.4
---
- Added support for searching for and fetching low latency data.

1.3
---

- Added support for path string interpolation, which allows you to do (for example)
  ``Fido.fetch(query, path=tmp_path / '{instrument}')`` and the name of the intrument will be used in the save path.
  This works for all supported Fido attrs.

1.2
---
- The ``Identifier`` attribute is deprecated - use ``Product`` instead, which
  is a direct replacement (with a better name!).
- Allow time-only searches to be made.
- Registered the ``Product`` attribute in the ``sunpy.net.attrs.soar``
  namespace. After running ``import sunpy.net.attrs as a``, the attribute can
  now be accessed using ``a.soar.Product``.
- The ``"Filesize"`` column in returned results now has units of
  ``astropy.units.Mbyte`` (previously it had no units).
- Removed a validation check on ``a.Level``. If an level that SOAR doesn't
  understand is passed, zero results will now be returned instead of an error
  being raised.

1.1
---
- Fixed download of data where multiple versions of the requested file are
  available. Only the most recent version will be downloaded.
- Added some log messages to the sunpy logger at DEBUG level

1.0
---
First stable sunpy-soar release.

- Fixed searches where there are no results.
- Added filesize to the result table
- Raise an error if the SOAR server can't be reached

1.0b1
-----
First sunpy-soar release.
