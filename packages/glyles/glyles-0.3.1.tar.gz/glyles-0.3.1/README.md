# GlyLES

![testing](https://github.com/kalininalab/glyles/actions/workflows/test.yaml/badge.svg)

A tool to convert IUPAC representation of Glycans into SMILES representation. This repo is still in the development 
phase; so, feel free to report any errors or issues.

## Specification and (current) Limitations

The exact specification we're referring to when talking about "IUPAC representations of glycan", is given in the 
"Notes" section of this [website](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/glycans/snfg.html). But as this package is still in the 
development phase, not everything of the specification is implemented yet (especially not all monomers and side chains 
you can attach to monomers).

This implementation currently only works for glycans that fulfill certain properties:

* Linkages have to be explicit, i.e. `(a1-4)`
* The structure of the glycan can be represented as a tree of the monomers with maximal branching factor 2.
* All root monomers (e.g. Glc, but not GlcNAc) from this [website](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/glycans/snfg.html) 
  (GalNAc is seen as modification of galactose)
* Some modifications can be added to the monomers, please see the [README](glyles/grammar/README.md) in the grammar
folder for more information on this. 

## Installation

So far, this package can only be downloaded from the python package index. So the installation with `pip` is very easy.
Just type

``````shell
pip install glyles
``````

and you're ready to use it as described below. Use 

````shell
pip install --upgrade glyles
````

to upgrade the glyles package to the most recent version.

## Usage

Convert the IUPAC into a SMILES representation using the handy `convert` method

``````python
from glyles.converter import convert

convert(glycan="Man(a1-2)Man", output_file="./test.txt")
``````

You can also use the `convert_generator` method to get a generator for all SMILES:

``````python
from glyles.converter import convert_generator

for smiles in convert_generator(glycan_list=["Man(a1-2)Man a", "Man(a1-2)Man b"]):
    print(smiles)
``````

In general, the `convert` and `convert_generator` methods support the same types of input. The samples are shown
for `convert` but it's the same for `convert_generator`.

* single glycan, e.g. `convert(glycan="Man(a1-2)Man)"`,
* a list of glycans, e.g. `convert(glycan_list=["Man(a1-2)Man a", "Man(a1-2)Man"])`, and
* a file of glycans, e.g. `convert(glycan_file="./glycans.txt")`. Here its important that the file many only contain one
  IUPAC per line.
* for better runtime one can also provide a generator as input, e.g. `convert(glycan_generator=some_generator)`

The output for `convert` can be manifold as well:

* `stdout` when specifying no output-related argument, or
* return as list of tuples if `returning=true` is set, or
* writing to an `output_file`, e.g. `convert(glycan="Man(a1-2)Man", output_file="./out.csv")`.

Any output consists of tuples of the form (input_iupac, smiles). The same also holds for `convert_generator` which returns 
tuples of input and smiles strings.


## Poetry

To develop this package, I used the poetry package manager (see [here](https://python-poetry.org/) for detailed
instruction). It has basically the same functionality as conda but supports the package management better and also 
supports distinguishing packages into those that are needed to use the package and those that are needed in the 
development of the package. To enable others to work on this repository, we also publish the exact 
specifications of our poetry environment.
