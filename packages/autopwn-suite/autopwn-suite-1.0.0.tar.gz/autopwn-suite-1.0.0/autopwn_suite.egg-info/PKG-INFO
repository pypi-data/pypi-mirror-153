## How does it work?

AutoPWN Suite uses nmap TCP-SYN scan to enumerate the host and detect the version of softwares running on it. After gathering enough information about the host, AutoPWN Suite automatically generates a list of "keywords" to search [NIST vulnerability database](https://www.nist.gov/).

### Demo

AutoPWN Suite has a very user friendly easy to read output.

### Installation

You will need [nmap](https://nmap.org) in order to use this tool.

On Debian based distros (Kali/Parrot etc):

```
sudo apt install nmap
```

On Arch based distros (BlackArch/ArchAttack etc):

```
sudo pacman -S nmap
```

After installing nmap you can just clone the repo.

```
git clone https://github.com/GamehunterKaan/AutoPWN-Suite.git
```
### Usage

```
usage: autopwn.py [-h] [-o OUTPUT] [-t TARGET] [-hf HOSTFILE] [-st SCANTYPE] [-s SPEED] [-a API] [-y] [-e]

AutoPWN Suite

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        Output file name. (Default : autopwn.log)
  -t TARGET, --target TARGET
                        Target range to scan. This argument overwrites the hostfile argument. (192.168.0.1 or 192.168.0.0/24)
  -hf HOSTFILE, --hostfile HOSTFILE
                        File containing a list of hosts to scan.
  -st SCANTYPE, --scantype SCANTYPE
                        Scan type. (Ping or ARP)
  -s SPEED, --speed SPEED
                        Scan speed. (0-5)
  -a API, --api API     Specify API key for vulnerability detection for faster scanning. You can also specify your API key in api.txt file. (Default : None)
  -y, --yesplease       Don't ask for anything. (Full automatic mode)
  -e, --evade           Evade the detection of the scanner. (Warning : Slower and slightly inaccurate!)
```

### TODO

- [x] Vulnerability detection based on version.
- [x] Easy to read output.
- [x] Functionality output results to a file.
- [ ] Function to automatically download exploit related to vulnerability.
- [ ] .deb package for Debian based systems like Kali Linux and Parrot Security.
- [ ] Arch Linux package for Arch based systems like BlackArch and ArchAttack.
- [ ] pypi package for easily installing with just `pip install autopwn-suite`.
- [ ] Seperate script for checking local privilege escalation vulnerabilities.
- [ ] Windows and OSX support.
- [ ] Functionality to brute force common services like `ssh`, `vnc`, `ftp` etc.
- [ ] Built in reverse shell handler that automatically stabilizes shell like [pwncat](https://github.com/calebstewart/pwncat).
- [ ] Function to generate reverse shell commands based on IP and port.
- [ ] GUI interface.
- [ ] Meterpreter payload generator with common evasion techniques.
- [ ] Fileless malware unique to AutoPWN Suite.
