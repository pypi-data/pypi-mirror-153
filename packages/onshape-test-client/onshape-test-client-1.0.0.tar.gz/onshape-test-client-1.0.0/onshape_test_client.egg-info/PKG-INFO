Description:     The Onshape REST API consumed by all client. # Authorization The simplest way to authorize and enable the **Try it out** functionality is to sign in to Onshape and use the current session. The **Authorize** button enables other authorization techniques. To ensure the current session isn&#x27;t used when trying other authentication techniques, make sure to remove the Onshape cookie as per the instructions for your particular browser. Alternatively, a private or incognito window may be used. Here&#x27;s [how to remove a specific cookie on Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647#zippy&#x3D;%2Cdelete-cookies-from-a-site). - **Current Session** authorization is enabled by default if the browser is already signed in to [Onshape](/). - **OAuth2** authorization uses an Onshape OAuth2 app created on the [Onshape Developer Portal](https://dev-portal.onshape.com/oauthApps). The redirect URL field should include &#x60;https://cad.onshape.com/glassworks/explorer/oauth2-redirect.html&#x60;. - **API Key** authorization using basic authentication is also available. The keys can be generated in the [Onshape Developer Portal](https://dev-portal.onshape.com/keys). In the authentication dialog, enter the access key in the &#x60;Username&#x60; field, and enter the secret key in the &#x60;Password&#x60; field. Basic authentication should only be used during the development process since sharing API Keys provides the same level of access as a username and password.  # noqa: E501
