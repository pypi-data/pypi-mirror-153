   Video display pipeline with AraViQ6

AraViQ6 (pronounced "Ara-vik") is a Python package for converting Qt6 `QVideoFrame <https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qvideoframe.html>`_ to :class:`numpy.ndarray` and display it on GUI.
This task is very common in scientific visualizing, especially in the field of image analysis.

AraViQ is designed to be used with either `PySide6 <https://pypi.org/project/PySide6/>`_ or `PyQt6 <https://pypi.org/project/PyQt6/>`_.
However, PyQt6 is not available until the dependent package, `qimage2ndarray <https://pypi.org/project/qimage2ndarray/>`_, supports it.

How to use
==========

AraViQ must be imported **after** the Qt package is imported.

.. code:: python

   import PySide6
   import araviq6 as avq

User can build a video pipeline to combine array manipulation and video displaying.
:class:`.FrameToArrayConverter` converts the video frame to numpy array.
After any desired processing is done, the resulting array can be passed to :class:`.NDArrayLabel` to be displayed.

:class:`.NDArrayVideoPlayerWidget` and :class:`.NDArrayCameraWidget` are convenience classes with pre-built pipelines.
Use these widgets if you need quick implementation of single-threaded video processing.
