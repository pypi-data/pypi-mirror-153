Coding Style and Best Practices
********************************
.. note::
   Until we have a site up for our best practices and coding style,
   the sphinx documentation site will host the coding style as well.

This page describes coding best practices applicable to the `pyansys
<https://pypi.org/project/pyansys/>`_ project.  The purpose of this
page is not to repeat coding style documentation, but rather to state
the approach used by the pyansys project when there are any
delineations, clarifications, or additional procedures above and
beyond `PEP8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`__.

For example, deprecation best practices are outlined in a `Stack
Overflow Answer <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2536307>`_ and
there's even a `Deprecation library
<https://deprecation.readthedocs.io/>`_ but there is no official
guidance regarding deprecating features in an API within Python.  This
document seeks to clarify this issue and others.

Aside from pyansys specific directives, the best coding practice is to simply
follow established guidelines from `PEP8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`__.


Deprecation Best Practice
-------------------------
Whenever a method, class, or function is deprecated, we must provide
an old method that calls the new method and raises a warning, or raise
an ``AttributeError`` if the method has been removed
altogether. Provide a `Sphinx Deprecated Directive
<https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/directives.html#directive-deprecated>`_
in the docstring of the older method and link to the newer method.

This way, when API changes are made we give the user a chance to
change theirs too or at least be notified when it changes. Otherwise,
they'll simply stop upgrading, or worse, using our API due to
stability concerns. For this reason, it's best to use a warning first
and then using an error after a minor release or two.


.. code:: python

    class FieldAnalysis2D():
        """Class docstring"""

        def assignmaterial(self, obj, mat):
            """Assign a material to one or more objects.

            .. deprecated:: 0.4.0
               Use :func:`FieldAnalysis2D.assign_material` instead.

            """
            # one of the following:

            # raise a DeprecationWarning. User won't have to change anything
            warnings.warn('`assignmaterial` is deprecated. Use `assign_material` instead.',
                          DeprecationWarning)
            self.assign_material(obj, mat)

            # or raise an AttributeError (could also make a custom DeprecationError)
            raise AttributeError('`assignmaterial` is deprecated. Use `assign_material` instead.')

        def assign_material(self, obj, mat):
            """Assign a material to one or more objects.
            ...
            """


If a method is outright removed, there's no reason to provide a link
to the old method, and we should simply raise an ``AttributeError``
should this be part of a class, or simply an ``Exception``.  For
example:

.. code:: python

    def hello_world():
        """Print ``"hello_world"``

        .. deprecated:: 0.4.0
            This function has been deprecated.

        """
        raise Exception('`my_function` has been deprecated')

Alternatively, you can create a custom ``DepricationError`` since
there is no built-in depreciation error within Python.

.. code:: python

    class DeprecationError(RuntimeError):
        """Used for depreciated methods and functions."""

        def __init__(self, message='This feature has been depreciated'):
            """Empty init."""
            RuntimeError.__init__(self, message)

Then simply use that inplace of ``Exception``

.. code:: python

    def hello_world():
        """Print ``"hello_world"``

        .. deprecated:: 0.4.0
            This function has been deprecated.

        """
        raise DeprecationError('`my_function` has been deprecated')

Imports Best Practice
---------------------

Following the `PEP8 guidelines <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#imports>`_,
imports should be added at the top of the file and should be grouped in this order:

1. Standard library imports.
2. Related third party imports.
3. Local application/library specific imports.

For example, consider the unorganized imports below:

.. code:: python

    import time
    import glob
    import re
    import numpy as np
    from ansys.mapdl.core.plotting import general_plotter
    from ansys.mapdl.core.post import PostProcessing
    import os
    import logging
    from shutil import rmtree, copyfile
    import weakref
    from ansys.mapdl.core.errors import MapdlRuntimeError, MapdlInvalidRoutineError
    from ansys.mapdl.core.commands import Commands
    from ansys.mapdl.core.inline_functions import Query

Organizing these same imports into groups vastly improves readibilty:

.. code:: python

    import time
    import glob
    import re
    import os
    import logging
    from shutil import rmtree, copyfile
    import weakref

    import numpy as np

    from ansys.mapdl.core.plotting import general_plotter
    from ansys.mapdl.core.post import PostProcessing
    from ansys.mapdl.core.errors import MapdlRuntimeError, MapdlInvalidRoutineError
    from ansys.mapdl.core.commands import Commands
    from ansys.mapdl.core.inline_functions import Query

We also recommend that the imports within a section be organized alphabetically.
Following this convention makes imports easily searchable. While this standard is optional,
it may be preferred in some projects.

.. code:: python

    import glob
    import logging
    import os
    import re
    import time
    import weakref
    from shutil import copyfile, rmtree

    import numpy as np
    
    from ansys.mapdl.core.commands import Commands
    from ansys.mapdl.core.errors import MapdlInvalidRoutineError, MapdlRuntimeError
    from ansys.mapdl.core.inline_functions import Query
    from ansys.mapdl.core.plotting import general_plotter
    from ansys.mapdl.core.post import PostProcessing

Additionally, we recommend to use absolute imports over relative imports because they are 
more readable and reliable:

.. code:: python

    # Not recommended
    from .core.plotting import general_plotter

    # Recommended
    from ansys.mapdl.core.plotting import general_plotter


Notes Regarding Semantic Versioning and API Changes
---------------------------------------------------
According to `Semantic Versioning <https://semver.org/>`_, you should
increment the MAJOR version when you make incompatible changes.
However, adding or eliminating methods should not be considered
incompatible changes to a code base, but rather incremental changes
what are backwards compatible (to a degree).  Therefore, whenever a
method or feature is added, changed, or removed, the minor version
should be bumped.

To avoid constantly bumping the minor version, one approach to for
source control branching is to create release branches where only
patch fixes are pushed to, and API changes occur between minor
releases.  See `Trunk Based Development
<https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/>`_.  In summary, the mainline
branch (commonly named ``main`` or ``master`` must be already read to
release, and developers should create release branches to maintain at
least of one prior minor version.

The reason behind this is if a user wants to use API 0.4.0 instead of
0.5.0 due to some pressing deadline where they want to avoid a code
refactor, the maintainers of the API can back-port a bug-fix via ``git
cherry-pick <COMMIT-HASH>``.  This way users are given some time to
update any projects dependent on the API while still being treated as
"first-class" users.  Note that due to the complexity of maintaining
multiple "release branches" in a repository, the number of active
release branches should be between one and three.

Docstring Examples Best Practice
--------------------------------
Defining docstring examples for methods and classes are extremely 
useful. The examples give users an easy place to start when trying 
out the API, by showing them exactly how to operate on a method or 
class. By using ``doctest`` through ``pytest``, docstring examples can 
also be used to perform regression testing to verify that the code is 
executing as expected.

This is an important feature of maintainable documentation as examples
must always match the API that they are documenting. Any changes within
the API without a corresponding change in the documentation will
trigger doctest failures.

Setting Up ``doctest``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
First, install ``pytest``:

.. code::

    pip install pytest

Then, ``doctest`` can be run on any Python file by running:

.. code::

    pytest --doctest-modules file.py

Here, ``doctest`` will search for any examples in the docstrings and will then
execute them to verify that they function as written.

Using ``pytest`` Fixtures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To define a setup sequence before the ``doctest`` run or before a given 
module is tested, you can use ``pytest`` fixtures. Because fixtures allow docstring 
examples to access shared objects, there is no need to repeat the setup
in each example.

You can define ``pytest`` fixtures in a ``conftest.py`` file next to the source 
code. The following example shows a fixture that is run automatically for 
each ``doctest`` session.

.. code:: python

    import pytest

    from pyaedt import Desktop


    @pytest.fixture(autouse=True, scope="session")
    def start_aedt():
        desktop = Desktop("2021.1", NG=True)
        desktop.disable_autosave()

        # Wait to run doctest on docstrings
        yield desktop
        desktop.force_close_desktop()

You can also define fixtures in a separate Python file from 
``conftest.py``. This may help keep the fixtures more organized. Fixtures 
from other files need to be imported in the main ``conftest.py`` file. The 
following example shows how to import fixtures defined in an 
``icepak_fixtures.py`` file under the ``doctest_fixtures`` folder.

.. code:: python

    import pytest

    from pyaedt import Desktop
    from pyaedt.doctest_fixtures import *

    # Import fixtures from other files
    pytest_plugins = [
        "pyaedt.doctest_fixtures.icepak_fixtures",
    ]


    @pytest.fixture(autouse=True, scope="session")
    def start_aedt():
        desktop = Desktop("2021.1", NG=True)
        desktop.disable_autosave()

        # Wait to run doctest on docstrings
        yield desktop
        desktop.force_close_desktop()

The ``doctest_namespace`` fixture built in to ``doctest`` allows injecting
items from a fixture into the context of the ``doctest`` run. To use this
feature, the fixture needs to accept the ``doctest_namespace`` dictionary
as an argument. Then, objects can be added to the ``doctest_namespace``
dictionary and used directly in a docstring example.

The code below shows how the ``Icepak`` object can be stored in the
``doctest_namespace`` dictionary by adding the key ``icepak`` with the 
``Icepak`` object as the value. 

.. code:: python

    import pytest
    from pyaedt import Icepak


    @pytest.fixture(autouse=True, scope="module")
    def create_icepak(doctest_namespace):
        doctest_namespace["icepak"] = Icepak(projectname="Project1", designname="IcepakDesign1")

Then, the ``Icepak`` object can be used directly inside a docstring
example, by referencing the key ``icepak``.

.. code:: python

    def assign_openings(self, air_faces):
        """Assign openings to a list of faces.

        Parameters
        ----------
        air_faces : list
            List of face names.

        Returns
        -------
        :class:`pyaedt.modules.Boundary.BoundaryObject`
            Boundary object when successful or ``None`` when failed.

        Examples
        --------

        Create an opening boundary for the faces of the ``USB_GND`` object.

        >>> faces = icepak.modeler.primitives["USB_GND"].faces
        >>> face_names = [face.id for face in faces]
        >>> boundary = icepak.assign_openings(face_names)
        pyaedt Info: Face List boundary_faces created
        pyaedt Info: Opening Assigned

        """

Useful Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ellipses for Random Output
**************************
If the output of some operation in an example cannot be verified exactly,
an ellipsis (``...``) can be used in the expected output. This allows it
to match any substring in the actual output.

.. code ::

    Examples
    --------

    >>> desktop = Desktop("2021.1")
    pyaedt Info: pyaedt v...
    pyaedt Info: Python version ...

To allow this, ``doctest`` must be run with the option set to allow ellipses.

.. code ::

    pytest --doctest-modules -o ELLIPSIS file.py

``doctest`` Skip
****************
The directive ``# doctest: +SKIP`` can be added to any line of a
docstring example so that it is not executed in ``doctest-modules``. This is useful for examples
that cannot run within ``pytest`` or have side-effects that will affect the other tests
if they are run during the ``doctest`` session.

.. code :: python

    Examples
    --------

    >>> desktop = Desktop("2021.1") # doctest: +SKIP
