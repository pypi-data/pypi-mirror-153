Inspired by state-of-the-art data augmentation technique, RandAug, we propose Text random data augmentation, that use randAug approach for text data. Any issue faced by you should be reported to i141637@nu.edu.pk 
Description of function is parameteres: 
training original: is input file in txt format, each line have a label separated from sentence by tab 
 output file: output file path 
       alpha_sr: parameter for controlling replacement 
      alpha_ri: parameter for controlling random insertion  
alpha_rs: parameter for controlling random swaping 
 alpha_rd: parameter for controlling random deletion 
num_aug: is number of augmentation, by default 9. Examples with demo will soon be released, (Under progress)
