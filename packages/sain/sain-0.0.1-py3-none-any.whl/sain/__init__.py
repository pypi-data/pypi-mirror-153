"""Standard Rust core types implementations for Python.

Equavilant types
----------------
- `Option<T>` -> `sain.Some[T]`
- `Result<T, E>` -> `sain.Result[T, E`. Not implemented yet.
- Default<T> -> `sain.Default[T]`
- AsRef<T> -> `sain.Ref[T]`. kinda...
- Iter<Item> -> `sain.

Equavilant macros
-----------------
- `cfg!()` -> `sain.cfg`.
- `#[cfg_attr]` -> `sain.cfg_attr`.

Examples
--------
```py
import sain

# If a non windows machine runs this function, it will raise an error.
@sain.cfg_attr(target_os = "win32")
def windows_only() -> sain.Some[int]:
    return sain.Some(1)

@sain.cfg_attr(requires_modules="uvloop", target_os = "unix")
def run_uvloop() -> None:
    windows_only().expect("Never.)  # RuntimeError("Never")

    import uvloop
    uvloop.install()

@sain.cfg_attr(python_version = (3, 5, 0))
class Foo:
    @staticmethod
    @sain.cfg_attr(requires_modules = ("numpy", "pandas"))
    async def bar() -> None:
        import numpy
        print(numpy.random.rand(10))
```

Notes
-----
Target OS must be one of the following:
* `linux`
* `win32`
* `darwin`
* `unix`, which is assumed to be either linux or darwin.

Target architecture must be one of the following:
* `x86`
* `x64`
* `arm`
* `arm64`

Target Python implementation must be one of the following:
* `CPython`
* `PyPy`
* `IronPython`
* `Jython`
