## FindTheGap


This package (also unformally known as "Gappy") provides tools for geometric data analysis, targeted at finding gaps and valleys in data distribution. It provides a (twice-differentiable) density estimator (Quartic Kernel Density Estimator) relying on pytorch for auto-differentiation, a routine to approximate critical points in the density ,and various statistics to identify and trace `gaps' and valleys in the distribution. 
 

This package can be installed through pip (https://pypi.org/project/findthegap/):

```
pip install findthegap 
```

See https://github.com/contardog/findthegap for demo and usecase notebook in the folder 'examples'.

Notebook requirements:
sklearn, matplotlib

The folder 'examples' contains a notebook showcasing how to use those tools on 2D data (available in the folder data). 



Disclaimer: this code is work in progress and might go through some changes especially for higher (>2!) dimension...
