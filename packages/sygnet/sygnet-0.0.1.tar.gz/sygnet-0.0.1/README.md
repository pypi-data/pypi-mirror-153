**sygnet** is a Python package for generating synthetic data within social science contexts. The **sygnet** algorithm uses cutting-edge advances in deep learning methods to learn the underlying relationships between variables in a dataset. Users can then generate brand-new, synthetic observations that mimic the real data.

### Installation
To install via pip, you can run the following command at the command line:
`pip install sygnet`

**sygnet** requires:
