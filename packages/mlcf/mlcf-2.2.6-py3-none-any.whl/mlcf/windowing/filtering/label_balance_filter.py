class LabelBalanceFilter(WindowFilter):
    """Label balancing filter.

    It will even out the histogram of a labeled feature.

    A labeled feature corresponds to the category of a value.
    Example: Having the feature X defined in the interval -1 and 1,
    if we decide to label this feature in 4 categories:
    - Values between -1 and -0.5 belong to label 0,
    - The values between -0.5 and 0 belong to the label 1,
    - Values between 0 and 0.5 belong to label 2,
    - Values between 0.5 and 1 belong to label 3.
    0, 1, 2, 3 are labeled feature of X.

    The histogram of these labeled features is constructed by taking into account the
    last index of each window.

    From a parameter called maximum occurrence, we select a number of lines so that the occurrence
    of each labeled feature does not exceed said parameter.

        max_occ (int): The maximum number of count for each label after the filtering

        We need to give the column to know which one will be taken into account to equalize
        the histogram.
        We can define the maximum occurrence parameter.
        Otherwise it will be determined automatically.
        We can give a selection function that will determine the selection method of
        the K windows such that K < {max_occ} for each label.

        Args:
            column (str): The label column on which the histogram is processed.

            max_occ (Optional[int], optional): The maximum number of occurence for each labeled
                feature. Defaults to None.

            sample_function (Callable, optional):
                A selection function that respects this format: fct(list, k) -> list_of_k_values.
                Defaults to random.sample.

            k (int): The window index counted from the end of the window that is used for filtering.
                Basically, we keep all the windows that have (for the label column used) the value
                'True' at the k-th window index (starting from the end). This is especially useful
                for filtering windows when the last index for the target will not be used.
                Defaults to 1.
