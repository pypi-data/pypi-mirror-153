gitlab-download-artifacts
=========================

This Python utility is used to download artifacts from gitlab ci.

It can be used to grab artifacts from a CI job matching a git repo (or submodule) at the current commit, or
from the https url of a repo, optionally at provided commit ref

gitlab-ci usage
---------------

When used in Gitlab CI a project / private token with api access will be required or user:pass specified in the url.
Currently (Jan 2022) the CI Job Token doesn't have enough api access to find the correct artifacts to download.

developer/desktop usage
-----------------------

If run from desktop the default browser will be used, however in this case an ``@<commit hash>`` cannot be used as
the gitlab artifact urls don't support this: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/job_artifacts.html#download-the-artifacts-archive

To download build artifacts for the current git project, simply run the tool from within the project folder and refer to the job whose artifacts are needed, eg:

::
  cd myproject
  gitlab-download-artifacts . build

The artifacts from the ``build`` job are downloaded and extracted into the current folder.


To download the artifacts for a submodule it can be used like:

::

  gitlab-download-artifacts ./submodule build

The artifacts will be downloaded from the commit the submodule is checked out at and expanded into its folder.

Alternatively to just grab from a project page:

::

  gitlab-download-artifacts https://gitlab.com/alelec/gitlab-download-artifacts@65ad5e1 release
