dl621
========================

A simple python module and CLI utility to download e621 images with embedded XMP tags and description


Installation
========================

The module requires Exempi, which is only available for Linux and Mac. Hence, this module only works on Linux and Mac.

To easily install everything via conda:

``conda env create -f environment.yml``

To manually install just the module (still needs Exempi installed seperately):

``pip install dl621``

To manually install Exempi on Debian:

``sudo apt-get install -y exempi``

Usage
========================

The program can be used as a simple command line program::

    $ dl621 -h
    usage: dl621 [-h] -i ID [-f FOLDER] [-n NAME] [-t] [-j] [-a USERNAME:API_KEY] [-u USERAGENT]

    Downloads e621 images with embedded XMP tags and description

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -i ID, --post_id ID   the ID of the e621 post
      -f FOLDER, --dl_folder FOLDER
                            the folder to download to
      -n NAME, --name_pattern NAME
                            the file name (no extention), Replacements: {m}=md5, {i}=post_id
      -t, --no_tags         don't embedd tags or metadata
      -j, --save_json       saves metadata in a seperate .json file in additon to other options
      -a USERNAME:API_KEY, --authorization USERNAME:API_KEY
                            your e621 username and API key
      -u USERAGENT, --user_agent USERAGENT
                            manual override of the user agent string


It can also be imported and used in your own scripts (default options shown)::

    import dl621

    r = dl621.download_image(post_id, output_folder=".", name_pattern="dl621_{i}_{m}", add_tags=True, save_json=False, use_messages=False, use_warnings=True, custom_json=None, auth=None, download_timeout=5, user_agent="dl621/1.0 (by nimaid on e621)")
    
    if r["saved_image"]:
        print("Image downloaded! Location:", r["path_image")
    else:
        print("Download failed!")

The ``download_image()`` function returns a dictionary with the following items:

* post_exists (bool)
* post_deleted (bool)
* post_missing_url (bool)
* saved_image (bool)
* saved_tags (bool)
* saved_json (bool)
* path_image (string)
* path_json (string)
