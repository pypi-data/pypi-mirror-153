class JobSpec(DataclassDictMixIn):
    """JobSpec describes how the job execution will look like.

      **parameters**

      * **template** ``core_v1.PodTemplateSpec`` - Describes the pod that will be created when executing a job. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/jobs-run-to-completion/
      * **activeDeadlineSeconds** ``int`` - *(optional)* Specifies the duration in seconds relative to the startTime that the job may
        be continuously active before the system tries to terminate it; value must be
        positive integer. If a Job is suspended (at creation or through an update),
        this timer will effectively be stopped and reset when the Job is resumed
        again.
      * **backoffLimit** ``int`` - *(optional)* Specifies the number of retries before marking this job failed. Defaults to 6
      * **completionMode** ``str`` - *(optional)* CompletionMode specifies how Pod completions are tracked. It can be
        `NonIndexed` (default) or `Indexed`.
        `NonIndexed` means that the Job is considered complete when there have been
        .spec.completions successfully completed Pods. Each Pod completion is
        homologous to each other.
        `Indexed` means that the Pods of a Job get an associated completion index from
        0 to (.spec.completions - 1), available in the annotation
        batch.kubernetes.io/job-completion-index. The Job is considered complete when
        there is one successfully completed Pod for each index. When value is
        `Indexed`, .spec.completions must be specified and `.spec.parallelism` must be
        less than or equal to 10^5. In addition, The Pod name takes the form
        `$(job-name)-$(index)-$(random-string)`, the Pod hostname takes the form
        `$(job-name)-$(index)`.
        More completion modes can be added in the future. If the Job controller
        observes a mode that it doesn't recognize, which is possible during upgrades
        due to version skew, the controller skips updates for the Job.
      * **completions** ``int`` - *(optional)* Specifies the desired number of successfully finished pods the job should be
        run with.  Setting to nil means that the success of any pod signals the
        success of all pods, and allows parallelism to have any positive value.
        Setting to 1 means that parallelism is limited to 1 and the success of that
        pod signals the success of the job. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/jobs-run-to-completion/
      * **manualSelector** ``bool`` - *(optional)* manualSelector controls generation of pod labels and pod selectors. Leave
        `manualSelector` unset unless you are certain what you are doing. When false
        or unset, the system pick labels unique to this job and appends those labels
        to the pod template.  When true, the user is responsible for picking unique
        labels and specifying the selector.  Failure to pick a unique label may cause
        this and other jobs to not function correctly.  However, You may see
        `manualSelector=true` in jobs that were created with the old
        `extensions/v1beta1` API. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/jobs-run-to-completion/#specifying-your-own-pod-selector
      * **parallelism** ``int`` - *(optional)* Specifies the maximum desired number of pods the job should run at any given
        time. The actual number of pods running in steady state will be less than this
        number when ((.spec.completions - .status.successful) < .spec.parallelism),
        i.e. when the work left to do is less than max parallelism. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/jobs-run-to-completion/
      * **selector** ``meta_v1.LabelSelector`` - *(optional)* A label query over pods that should match the pod count. Normally, the system
        sets this field for you. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#label-selectors
      * **suspend** ``bool`` - *(optional)* Suspend specifies whether the Job controller should create Pods or not. If a
        Job is created with suspend set to true, no Pods are created by the Job
        controller. If a Job is suspended after creation (i.e. the flag goes from
        false to true), the Job controller will delete all active Pods associated with
        this Job. Users must design their workload to gracefully handle this.
        Suspending a Job will reset the StartTime field of the Job, effectively
        resetting the ActiveDeadlineSeconds timer too. Defaults to false.
      * **ttlSecondsAfterFinished** ``int`` - *(optional)* ttlSecondsAfterFinished limits the lifetime of a Job that has finished
        execution (either Complete or Failed). If this field is set,
        ttlSecondsAfterFinished after the Job finishes, it is eligible to be
        automatically deleted. When the Job is being deleted, its lifecycle guarantees
        (e.g. finalizers) will be honored. If this field is unset, the Job won't be
        automatically deleted. If this field is set to zero, the Job becomes eligible
        to be deleted immediately after it finishes.

        happens-before order across separate operations. It is represented in RFC3339
        form and is in UTC. The completion time is only set when the job finishes

      * **conditions** ``List[JobCondition]`` - *(optional)* The latest available observations of an object's current state. When a Job
        fails, one of the conditions will have type "Failed" and status true. When a
        Job is suspended, one of the conditions will have type "Suspended" and status
        true; when the Job is resumed, the status of this condition will become false.

        feature gate JobReadyPods is enabled (enabled by default).
      * **startTime** ``meta_v1.Time`` - *(optional)* Represents time when the job controller started processing a job. When a Job
        is created in the suspended state, this field is not set until the first time

        The job controller creates pods with a finalizer. When a pod terminates
        (succeeded or failed), the controller does three steps to account for it in
        the job status: (1) Add the pod UID to the arrays in this field. (2) Remove
        the pod finalizer. (3) Remove the pod UID from the arrays while increasing the
