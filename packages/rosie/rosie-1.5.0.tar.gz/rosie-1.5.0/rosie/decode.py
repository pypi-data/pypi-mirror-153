# About decode:
#
# When 'inputstring' argument is None, the decoder will return a parse
# tree without any 'data' fields.  It will have 'type', 's', and 'e'
# fields only, where s and e are start/end and are 1-based.
#
# When the `inputstring` argument is a bytes or str object, the
# decoder returns a parse tree whose nodes include a 'data' field
# containing a COPY (of type bytes or str, depending on the type of
# inputstring) of inputstring[s-1, e-1].
#
# When the `inputstring` argument is a memoryview object, the
# decoder returns a parse tree whose nodes include a 'data' field
# containing a memoryview slice of inputstring[s-1, e-1].
#
