# simple_rss_reader

As an happy customer of Alfred 4 APP, i was in a need for simplest RSS parser.
I decided to write the simplest one for my needs. 

Then i said to myself, why not to make it open source as a package for anyone who need it. 
Although its 2022, and XML should be an no more then  (not so great) history, i know that if i need it, i can only assume i am not the only one. 

Feel free to use, fork, and learn (although it is as minimal and simple as possible)


## INSTALL

```
pip install  yet-another-simple-rss-parser
