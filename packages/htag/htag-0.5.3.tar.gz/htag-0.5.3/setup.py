But they are just here, for the show. IRL: you should build your own, for your needs.\n\n## To have a look\n\nSee the [demo source code](https://github.com/manatlan/htag/blob/main/examples/demo.py)\n\nTo try it :\n\n    $ pip3 install htag pywebview\n    $ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/manatlan/htag/main/examples/demo.py\n    $ python3 demo.py\n\nThere will be docs in the future ;-)\n\n## ROADMAP to 1.0.0\n\n * rock solid (need more tests)\n * ~~top level api could change (Tag() -> create a Tag, Tag.mytag() -> create a TagBase ... can be a little bit ambiguous)~~\n * add a runner with WS with stdlib ? (not starlette!)\n * I don\'t really like the current way to generate js in interaction : need to found something more solid.\n * ~~the current way to initiate the statics is odd (only on real (embedded) Tag\'s) : should find a better way (static like gtag ?!)~~\n\n\n',
