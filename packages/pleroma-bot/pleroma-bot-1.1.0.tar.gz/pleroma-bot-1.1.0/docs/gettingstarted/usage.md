# Usage

Once you have your config ready, launch ```pleroma-bot``` like so:

=== ":material-language-python: Using PyPi"

    ```console
    $ pleroma-bot
    ```

    !!! info "If using a virtual environment, you'll have to activate before you're able to run it"
    ```console
    $ source myenv/bin/activate
    (myenv) $ pleroma-bot
    ```

=== ":material-arch: Using AUR package"

    ```console
    $ pleroma-bot
    ```

=== ":material-git: Using Git"

    ```console
    $ python3 -m pleroma_bot.cli
    ```

!!! note "An ```error.log``` file will be created at the path from which ```pleroma-bot``` is being called (current working directory). Make sure you have write permissions on it"

## First run

When running the bot for the first time it will ask you for the date you wish to start retrieving tweets from.

It will gather *all* tweets from that date up to the present. 
If you don't input any value and press ++enter++ it will default to the oldest date that Twitter's API allows ('```2010-11-06T00:00:00Z```') for tweet retrieval.

To force this behaviour in the future, you can use the ```--forceDate``` argument.

!!! warning "Be careful, no validation is performed with the already posted toots/posts by that Fediverse account and you can end up with duplicates posts/toots!"

Additionally, you can provide the ```twitter_username``` value if you only want to force the date for that particular user in your config.

For example:

```console
$ pleroma-bot --forceDate WoolieWoolz
```

## Only gather tweets

If the ```--noProfile``` argument is passed, *only* tweets will be posted. The profile picture, banner, display name and bio will **not** be updated on the Fediverse account and will be skipped for all users in the config.

Alternatively, you can also choose to use the `no_profile` [mapping on your config](/pleroma-bot/gettingstarted/configuration/#mappings), setting it to `true` on the users you wish to do so:
```yaml hl_lines="5"
- twitter_username: MyTwitterUser
  pleroma_username: MyPleromaUser
  pleroma_base_url: https://fedi.instance
  pleroma_token: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
  no_profile: true  # <--
```
This is useful if for whatever reason (data caps, server bandwidth) you prefer not downloading the profile image, banner, etc. every run.

## Custom path for log and config

Arguments ```--config``` and ```--log``` can be used to specify a specific path for the configuration file and where the log file should be written to.

```console
$ pleroma-bot --config /path/to/config.yml --log /path/to/error.log
```

When these arguments are omitted, ```config.yml``` from the current directory will be used as a configuration file and an ```error.log``` file will be written to the current working directory.

## Using an archive

A Twitter [archive](https://twitter.com/settings/your_twitter_data) can also be provided with `--archive`:

```console
$ pleroma-bot --archive /path/to/archive.zip
```

This is particularly useful when trying to circumvent Twitter's API limitations, when you need to copy more than 3200 tweets or from an earlier date than `2010-11-06T00:00:00Z`.

It can also be used as a way of transferring all of your Twitter's account data to a Fediverse instance and making the migration process easier.
