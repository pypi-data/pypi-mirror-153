		Constructor.

		Parameters
		----------
		learner_func : func | callable
			Function or callable that expects one optional argument :code:`n_vars` and returns an instance of a superviser learner (regressor or classifier) following the scikit-learn convention, and expecting :code:`n_vars` features.
			
			Specifically, the learner should have a :code:`fit(x_train, y_train)` method. The learner should also have a :code:`feature_importances_` property or attribute, which is an array or a list containing feature importances once the model has been trained.

			There should be as many importance scores in :code:`feature_importances_` as columns in :code:`x_train`.

		Performs a run of the Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) feature selection algorithm.

		Starting with all features, we recursively train a learner, calculate all feature importance scores, remove the least important feature, and repeat until we are left with :code:`n_vars` features.

		Parameters
		----------
		x_df : pd.DataFrame
			A dataframe containing all features.
		y_df : pd.DataFrame
			A dataframe containing the target.
		n_vars : int
			The number of features to keep.
		max_duration : float | None (default)
			If not None, then feature elimination will stop after this many seconds.

		Attributes
		----------
		selected_variables : list
			The list of the :code:`n_vars` features we kept.


		Returns
		-------
		m : sklearn-like model (an instance returned by :code:`learner_func`)
			An instance returned by :code:`learner_func` trained with the :code:`n_vars` features we kept.
