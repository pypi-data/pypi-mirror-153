    ''' Function for computing a basic metric of reliability.

    Notes on NaN's:
    - NaN's may not be passed in the covars_df, stratify or perf_series.

    - If there are any NaN's in the data, when residualizing each voxel/vertex,
    that subject will be excluded from calculating that voxel/vertex's residual,
    but will still be included in every case where they have a non-nan value.
    Essentially the NaN value will propegate into the residualized data.
    Likewise, when calculating the cohen's map, any nan values will simply
    be skipped when calculating the mean and std. 

    - If there are any NaN's in either the group to compares cohens map,
    or the base cohen's map, then those voxels / vertex will be excluded
    when calculating the correlation coef. between the two maps. NaN's
    will show up here if the standard deviation for that feature
    across subjects is 0.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    covars_df : pandas DataFrame
        A pandas dataframe containing any co-variates in which
        the loaded data should be residualized by.

        Note: The dataframe must be indexed by subject name!

    data_df : pandas DataFrame or None
        Dataframe indexed by subject name that contains
        the data to be used. Note if provided then
        this will replace any arguments passed to
        contrast, template_path, mask and index_slice.

    contrast : str
        The name of the contrast, used along with the template
        path to define where to load data.

        This parameter is ignored if data_df is not None.

    template_path : str
        A str indicating the template form for how a single
        subjects data should be loaded, where SUBJECT will be
        replaced with that subjects name, and CONTRAST will
        be replaced with the contrast name.

        For example, so load subject X's contrast Y saved at:
        some_loc/X_Y.nii.gz.
        
        You would pass:
        some_loc/SUBJECT_CONTRAST.nii.gz

        As the template path.

        This parameter is ignored if data_df is not None.

    mask : str, numpy array or None
        After data is loaded, it can optionally be
        masked. By default, this parameter is set to None.
        If None, then the subjects data will be flattened.
        If passed a str, it will be assumed to be the location of a mask
        in which to load, which will then use nibabel's load function
        and then get_fdata() to extract a binary mask, where the shape
        of the mask should match the data and also entries set to True or
        1, indicate that that value be kept when loading data.
        Lastly, a numpy array, where 1 == a value should be kept, with
        likewise the same shape as the data to load can be passed here.

        This parameter is ignored if data_df is not None.

    index_slice : slices, tuple of slices, or None
        You may optional pass index slicing here. This will be applied
        before the mask. The benefit of using index slicing over a mask
        is that in the case where say your data is of shape 5 x 20 on
        the disk, but you only need the data in the first 20, e.g.,
        so with traditional slicing that is [0], in this case by using the
        mask you have to load the full data from the disk, then slice it.
        But if you pass slice(0) here, then this accomplishes the same thing,
        but only loads the requested slice from the disk.

        You must use slice for complex slicing, in the example above you could just
        pass (0) or slice(0), but if you wanted something more complex, e.g. passing
        something like my_array[1:5:2, ::3] you should pass
        (slice(1,5,2), slice(None,None,3)) here.
        
        By default this is None.

        This parameter is ignored if data_df is not None.

    stratify : None or pandas Series
        By default this is None. If passed a series though,
        then this series is expected to be indexed by subject,
        with the same subjects as the passed covars_df. This series
        of values will then be passed to the train_test_split function,
        and will specify that stratifying behavior is requested.

        Stratifying behavior will be applied for only the main
        split, and will ensure or rather try to ensure that the
        same distribution of class values will be present in each split.

        If this is passed as a series, then groups must be None.

    groups : None or pandas Series
        By default this is None, if passed a series, then this
        series is expected to be indexed by subject, with
        the same subjects as the passed covars_df. This series
        will then be used to define the main train_test_split,
        but will perform it according to group preserving behavior,
        where members of the same group (as passed here) will
        be preserved within the same split.

        If this is passed as a series, then stratify must be None.

    proc_covars_func : None, function
        By default, this is set to None. Alternatively, you
        may pass a function in which the first positional argument accepts
        a subset of the covars_df, and then returns a processed version of
        the covar df. This is useful for preforming pre-processing on the
        covars_df separately for each group of subjects.

    perf_series : None or pandas Series
        By default None. If not None, then this should
        be a series indexed by subject id. The cohen's
        will not be calculated anymore, instead the reliability
        for the residualized data as correlated with this
        series will be computed instead.

    proc_type : 'split' or 'every'
        This defines the behavior of the reliability test.
        In the first case, 'split', the covars df will be processed
        seperately across each of the two main groups (if proc_covars_func is None),
        and also each groups residualized data computed on each full half.
        
        Alternatively, if 'every' is passed, then the gold standard group will still be processed
        all together, but the comparison group will be processed and likewise
        residualized seperately for each comparison group! Warning: this
        can take longer to compute.

    thresh : float or None
        By default, this is set to None. This value if not none
        indicates an absolute value threshold in which only voxels / vertex
        in the comparison map above this threshold should be used
        to calculate the correlation between the random group and this
        base map.

    min_size : int
        By default this is set to 5. This is the starting
        group size to compare with the split half sample.

        Where random groups sizes are defined by:
        x_labels = list(range(min_size, max_size, every))

    max_size : int
        By default this is set to 1000. This is the maximum
        size to compare with the split half sample.

        Where random groups sizes are defined by:
        x_labels = list(range(min_size, max_size, every))

    every : int
        By default this value is 1, it determines
        jumps to the groups size.

        Where random groups sizes are defined by:
        x_labels = list(range(min_size, max_size, every))

    n_repeats : int
        By default = 100. This value controls
        how many times each of the group sizes should
        be evaluated with a different random group of that size.

    n_jobs : int
        The number of jobs to try and use for loading and the rely test.

    split_random_state : int
        By default 2. Can pass different int's.
        This is the random state for the random tr test split.

    verbose : int
        By default this value is 1. This parameter
        controls the verbosity of this function.

        If -1, then no message at all will be printed.
        If 0, only warnings will be printed.
        If 1, general status updates will be printed.
        If >= 2, full verbosity will be enabled.

        subjects data should be loaded, where SUBJECT will be
        replaced with that subjects name, and CONTRAST will
        be replaced with the contrast name.

        For example, so load subject X's contrast Y saved at:
        some_loc/X_Y.nii.gz.
        
        You would pass:
        some_loc/SUBJECT_CONTRAST.nii.gz

        As the template path.

    mask : str, numpy array or None
        After data is loaded, it can optionally be
        masked. By default, this parameter is set to None.
        If None, then the subjects data will be flattened.
        If passed a str, it will be assumed to be the location of a mask
        in which to load, which will then use nibabel's load function
        and then get_fdata() to extract a binary mask, where the shape
        of the mask should match the data and also entries set to True or
        1, indicate that that value be kept when loading data.
        Lastly, a numpy array, where 1 == a value should be kept, with
        likewise the same shape as the data to load can be passed here.

    index_slice : slices, tuple of slices, or None
        You may optional pass index slicing here. This will be applied
        before the mask. The benefit of using index slicing over a mask
        is that in the case where say your data is of shape 5 x 20 on
        the disk, but you only need the data in the first 20, e.g.,
        so with traditional slicing that is [0], in this case by using the
        mask you have to load the full data from the disk, then slice it.
        But if you pass slice(0) here, then this accomplishes the same thing,
        but only loads the requested slice from the disk.

        You must use slice for complex slicing, in the example above you could just
        pass (0) or slice(0), but if you wanted something more complex, e.g. passing
        something like my_array[1:5:2, ::3] you should pass
        (slice(1,5,2), slice(None,None,3)) here.
        
        By default this is None.

    resid : bool
        If the data should be residualized or not. True by default
        for yes, if False, then raw data will be returned.

    n_jobs : int
        The number of jobs to try and use for loading and the rely test.

    verbose : int
        By default this value is 1. This parameter
        controls the verbosity of this function.

        If -1, then no message at all will be printed.
        If 0, only warnings will be printed.
        If 1, general status updates will be printed.
        If >= 2, full verbosity will be enabled.

    Parameters
    -----------
    covars_df : pandas DataFrame
        A pandas dataframe containing any co-variates in which
        the loaded data should be residualized by.

        Note: The dataframe must be indexed by subject name!

    contrast : str
        The name of the contrast, used along with the template
        path to define where to load data.

    template_path : str
        A str indicating the template form for how a single
        subjects data should be loaded, where SUBJECT will be
        replaced with that subjects name, and CONTRAST will
        be replaced with the contrast name.

        For example, so load subject X's contrast Y saved at:
        some_loc/X_Y.nii.gz.
        
        You would pass:
        some_loc/SUBJECT_CONTRAST.nii.gz

        As the template path.

    popmean : float or array_like, optional
        Expected value in null hypothesis. If array_like,
        then it must have the same shape as a excluding the axis dimension.

        default = 0

    alpha : float
        The error rate in the fdr correction.

        covars_df : pandas DataFrame
        A pandas dataframe containing any co-variates in which
        the loaded data should be residualized by.

        Note: The dataframe must be indexed by subject name!

    mask : str, numpy array or None
        After data is loaded, it can optionally be
        masked. By default, this parameter is set to None.
        If None, then the subjects data will be flattened.

        Lastly, a numpy array, where 1 == a value should be kept, with
        likewise the same shape as the data to load can be passed here.

    reverse_mask : bool, optional
        Can optionally reverse the masking, assuming that no index_slice is
        passed! If mask is passed as array, then will project data
        back as array. If mask is passed as location to nii, then data will
        be put back as a nifti object.

    index_slice : slices, tuple of slices, or None
        You may optional pass index slicing here. This will be applied
        before the mask. The benefit of using index slicing over a mask
        is that in the case where say your data is of shape 5 x 20 on

        By default this is None.
