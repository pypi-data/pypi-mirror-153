    @brief: This script produces GMAT model Include files containing 
    variants of model resource values and parameters.  

    @copyright: Copyright (C) 2019 - 2022 Freelance Rocket Science, All rights reserved.

    @author  Colin Helms, colinhelms@outlook.com, [CCH]

    @details:
    The module provides function to implement batch processing of different 
    mission scenarios in which the spacecraft configuration and/or 
    initial orbital elements vary.
    
    The approach utilizes the GMAT 2018a #Include macro, which loads resources and 
    script snippets from external files.  The script creates Include files whose
    parameter and resource values vary in accordance with an Excel workbook.
    
    A top level GMAT script template must exist in the GMAT model directory.
    This script template will be copied and modified by modelgen.py.
    The script template must contain the GMAT create statements for GMAT resources.
      
    The script template must contain three #Include statements as follows:
    (1) a GMAT script file defining the static resources, those that don't change per run
    (2) An include file defining those variables written by "modelgen.py".
    (3) An include file containing the GMAT Mission Sequence definition.
    
    The second #Include statement will be modified by modelgen.py to include a
    uniquely named filepath and the entire template copied to a "batch" directory
    as a unique filename.
    
    At completion as list of these filenames will be written out as a filename in
    the GMAT model output_file path.  The model name will be of the form:
        [Mission Name] + '__RunList_[Julian Date-time] + '.batch'
    Example: "AlfanoXfer__RunList_J009_0537.25.batch"
    
    Input:
    A dictionary is used to drive the actual resources and parameters written to
    Include macro file 2.  The dictionary is factored into "modelpov.py" such
    that additional resources may be added or deleted without change to code.
    
    Include file 1 must be extracted from the initial model file written by GMAT, 
    the model design is the responsibility of the GMAT user.  The points of variation
    must also be updated in "modelpov.py" for the case of a new model.
    
    The external module "fromconfigsheet.py" is called to read excel worksheet
    to update the values of the dictionary.
 
    The Alfano trajectory is used in the current model mission, and a user defined
    parameter, the costate, must be updated in concert with the inclination to
    execute the Alfano-Edelbaum yaw control law.
    The costate calculation is out of scope as of this version [TODO]. So is 
    specified in the configsheet workbook.
        
    Notes:
       1. To model the return trip of the reusable vehicle, two include files
            must be generated, one with payload mass included, one without.
       2. Dry mass varies with the vehicle power and thrust.
       3. Efficiency, thrust and Isp vary with the selected thruster set-points.
       4. In order to cover the range of eclipse conditions the EOTV Epoch is
            varied for the four seasons:
                20 Mar 2020 03:49 UTC
                20 Jun 2020 21:43 UTC
                22 Sep 2020 13:30 UTC
                21 Dec 2020 10:02 UTC
                The epoch date is specified in the configsheet workbook.
       5. Propellant is given as an initial calculation, then the actual value
            from a run is substituted and the model rerun until convergence.
            This iterative process is executed by "modeliterate.py", however
            the code and data architecture must be factored for reuse.
       6. The output is a .csv file and it's name must not only be varied for each
            model, but also for each iteration of the model. An example is,
            'ReportFile_AlfanoXfer_20Jun2020_28.5i_64x5999_16T_Run3.csv'.
       7. The external module "modeliterate.py" must be able to identify and open
            the output file.
       8. The OrbitView viewpoint is superfluous in most cases, since model execution
            is intended to be in batch mode for this system.  However, if graphic
            output is desired, the convention is to vary the viewpoint with the 
            Starting Epoch as follows:
                20 Mar 2020 03:49 UTC, [ 80000 0 20000 ]
                20 Jun 2020 21:43 UTC, [ 0 80000 20000 ]
                22 Sep 2020 13:30 UTC, [ 0 -80000 20000 ]
                21 Dec 2020 10:02 UTC, [ -80000 0 20000 ]
                   
    The top level GMAT script is intended to be called by the GMAT batch facility,
    therefore each variation of Include file 2 must be matched by a uniquely named
    top level GMAT script.
    
    Each model variation is executed for one or more user-defined Epoch dates, 
    therefore the number of top-level scripts to be generated is the number of 
    configurations in the configuration worksheet times the number of Epochs in the
    epoch list
    
    The model Include file name shall be unique for each different variation.
    The name shall be of the form:
        'case_''[num HET]'X'[power]'_'[payload mass]'_'[epoch]'_'[inclination]
    
    modelgen.py is coded to avoid overwriting an existing model file. The current 
    Julian day and time is suffixed to each filename.

    Module "modelgen.py" shall output each top level file as well as a 
    list of batch filenames.
    
    Input: 
        An Excel worksheet containing the points of variation
    as values for resources in columns with headings as above.
    
    Output: 
        A series of GMAT #Include files with resources and values, one for each line
        of the input workbook
        A series of uniquely named GMAT top-level model files, one for each line of
        the input workbook.
        A GMAT batch file listing the names of the above model files.
    
    TODO: the initial baseline depends on the exact spacecraft and hardware
    created in the top level template.  Four of these represent points of 
    variation in general:
        Create Spacecraft EOTV;
        Create ElectricThruster HET1;
        Create SolarPowerSystem EOTVSolarArrays;
        Create ElectricTank RAPTank1;
    Furthermore, there may be multiple ReportFile creates under various names.
    These instance dependencies can be avoided by reading and interpreting ModelMissionTemplate.script.
