    @brief: This routine reads the batchfile created by modelgen.py, 
    and executes GMAT in command line mode for each filename found in the batchfile.

    @details:
    Assumption 1: GMAT.exe is in the executable path.
    Assumption 2: A batchfile exists in the user's directory 
        consisting of a line-by-line list of model filenames to be executed.
    Assumption 3: The user's platform is capable of executing each model file
        with 5 minutes.  If not, change the cpto global variable below.
