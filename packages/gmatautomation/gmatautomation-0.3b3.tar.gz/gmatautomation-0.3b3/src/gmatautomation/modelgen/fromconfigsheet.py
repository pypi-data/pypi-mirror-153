    @brief: This module reads configurations from the "Vehicle Optimization Tables" workbook 
    and returns a corresponding specification of various cases of GMAT model resources. It
    is currently a point design in support of variations in the AlfanoXfer.script GMAT models.

    @details Interface Agreement: An Excel workbook exists which contains a 
    sheet named "GMAT" having a contiguous table starting in cell "A1".  
    The table consists of a first line of parameter names and successive lines 
    of spacecraft properties and relevant hardware configuration.
    
    The first line of table headings may not be exactly the same as GMAT resource names.  
    The associated routine, "modelpov.py" defines a mapping of required GMAT
    resource names to worksheet table headings, which we refer to as parameter names.  
    Procedure modelgen.py will use this association to generate the correct 
    GMAT resource names.  Procedure fromconfigsheet.py will extract only the parameter 
    names defined in modelpov.py. Note that it is possible with this logic to extract NO
    data from the workbook, in this case the model.pov file may be edited to include
    the intended parameter names, or the workbook may be so edited.
    
    Variation of orbital elements is independent of hardware configuration.  Specifically,
    inclination cases may be multiple for the given "GMAT" table and are gleaned from
    a separate n x 1 table of values in named range, "Inclinations" contained in
    a sheet named "Mission Params".
    
    Similarly, cases of initial epoch to be executed are gleaned from n x 4 table of values
    in named range, "Starting Epoch" on a sheet named "Mission Params". Each row, n,
    contains a UTC formatted time and date value in column 1, e.g. 
    "20 Mar 2020 03:49:00.000 UTC".

    For display, a GMAT viewpoint vector consisting of x, y, and z components of
    rendering camera position (in the J2000 ECI coordinate system) are associated
    with each epoch value, and are contained in columns (n,2), (n,3), and (n,4) of
    the "Starting Epoch" named range.
    
    Inputs:
        fname - this is the path specification for the "Vehicle Optimizations
        Tables" workbook.  The QFileDialog() from PyQt may be used to browse for the
        workbook file.
