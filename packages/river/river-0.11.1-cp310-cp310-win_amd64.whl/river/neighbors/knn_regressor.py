    """K-Nearest Neighbors regressor.

    This non-parametric regression method keeps track of the last `window_size`
    training samples. Predictions are obtained by aggregating the values of the
    closest n_neighbors stored-samples with respect to a query sample.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_neighbors
        The number of nearest neighbors to search for.

    window_size
        The maximum size of the window storing the last observed samples.

    aggregation_method
        The method to aggregate the target values of neighbors.
            | 'mean'
            | 'median'
            | 'weighted_mean'

    min_distance_keep
        The minimum distance (similarity) to consider adding a point to the window.
        E.g., a value of 0.0 will add even exact duplicates. Default is 0.05 to add
        similar but not exactly the same points.

    distance_func
        An optional distance function that should accept an a=, b=, and any
        custom set of kwargs (defined in distance_func_kwargs). If not defined,
        the default Minkowski distance is used.

    Notes
    -----
    See the NearestNeighbors documentation for details about the base model,
    along with KNNBase for an example of providing your own distance function.
