    Command line app and framework for receiving Pushover push notifications in real time


Soon...

.. _pyscaffold-notes:

How to test it for now
----------------------

The script expects a file at the home directory named ``~/.pushover-open-client-creds.json``. The file should be a JSON file with account's ``email`` and ``password``, this way:

file: ``~/.pushover-open-client-creds.json``
--------------------------------------------

::

  {
    "email": "USERS@EMAIL.ETC",
    "password": "M4HSUP3RBPASS"
  }

Given the above, by logging and getting an auth secret, a new device will be created wielding it's device_id, and that file will be updated containing all these four values
