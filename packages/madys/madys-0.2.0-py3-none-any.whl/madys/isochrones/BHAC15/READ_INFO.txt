Models from Baraffe, Homeier, Allard, Chabrier 2015, A&A,577, 42
"New evolutionary models for pre-main sequence and main sequence low-mass stars down to the hydrogen-burning limit"

NOTE: Isochrones in different filters will be regularly added on this site.

The file BHAC15_tracks+structure include tracks and some information on the internal structure
(mass of the radiative core, gyration radii, central temperature and densities, etc...).
