----- ATMO 2020 README -----

These directories contain the "ATMO 2020" model set from Phillips et al. (2020)

Atmosphere models spanning Teff=200-3000K, log(g)=2.5-5.5 with equilibrium and 
non-equilibrium chemistry are provided in the atmosphere_models/ directory.
*** Note that the range of validity of our models is Teff<2000K, since we do not 
*** include some sources of opacity that form at higher temperatures. We extend our
*** model atmospheres to Teff=3000K in order to follow the evolution of the most 
*** massive brown dwarfs from very early stages. 

Evolutionary tracks are calculated using the atmosphere models as surface boundary 
conditions and are provided for substellar objects spanning 0.0005-0.075M/Msun in the 
evolutionary_tracks/ directory.

These models are also available on http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/isabelle.baraffe/ATMO2020/ 
along with previous model grids.

More information about these models can be found in Phillips et al. (2020)

Please contact mp537@exeter.ac.uk with any questions or requests.

Please also contact mp537@exeter.ac.uk before using these models in publications 
so that we can verify that our model assumptions are adequate for your purpose.
