What is the meaning of the label (or stage) in the isochrones?
The label was implemented with the PARSEC v1.2S tracks, to divide input tracks and output isochrones into rough "evolutionary sections". They have not been carefully checked for all masses and metallicities, and we know of the presence of some misclassified points in output. Nonetheless, many people (including ourselves) find these labels very useful. Use them with caution! Their approximate meaning is:
0 = PMS, pre main sequence
1 = MS, main sequence
2 = SGB, subgiant branch, or Hertzsprung gap for more intermediate+massive stars
3 = RGB, red giant branch, or the quick stage of red giant for intermediate+massive stars
4 = CHEB, core He-burning for low mass stars, or the very initial stage of CHeB for intermediate+massive stars
5 = still CHEB, the bluward part of the Cepheid loop of intermediate+massive stars
6 = still CHEB, the redward part of the Cepheid loop of intermediate+massive stars
7 = EAGB, the early asymptotic giant branch, or a quick stage of red giant for massive stars
8 = TPAGB, the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch
9 = post-AGB (still missing!)
