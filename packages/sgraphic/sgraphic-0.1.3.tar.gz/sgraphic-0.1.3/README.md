# Sgraphic - Simple graphic

![simple graphics exaple](img/example.png)

##  Very simple 2d graphics package
Basically just a wrapper of the brilliant [skia python](https://github.com/kyamagu/skia-python) package.
This package exist because i needed a simple 2d graphic plotter with Ipython support and matplotlib inspired syntax.
[P5py](https://github.com/p5py/p5) is close but it is slow and does not support anti-aliasing yet.

SG can't do a lot yet but it is simple and fast.

Does not support interaction or 3d.
