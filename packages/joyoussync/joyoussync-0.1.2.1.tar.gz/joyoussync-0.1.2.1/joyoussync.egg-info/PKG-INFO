# joyoussync

[joyous](https://github.com/linuxsoftware/ls.joyous) is a calendar app for the wagtail CMS.
It supports ical import from file,
but unfortunately not subscription to ical URLs.
This is an attempt to add this support for a very narrow usecase.

Subscription a managed via a settingsmenu in wagtail admin.
The sync is done using Django Q to execute sync functions continuously in the background.
This means you also have to setup Django Q, but all you have to do for that is described here.
